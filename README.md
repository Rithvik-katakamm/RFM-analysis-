# RFM Analysis Project
## Overview
This project conducts an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis to segment customers and provide targeted marketing strategies. By analyzing customer purchasing behavior, demographics, and value, we offer tailored approaches for different customer segments including Best Customers, Loyal Customers, Big Spenders, and others. The project also delves into profit analysis and approaches for datasets lacking direct customer feedback.

## Features
1. Customer Segmentation: Utilizes RFM analysis for insightful customer segmentation.
2. Marketing Recommendations: Provides specific marketing strategies for each customer segment.
3. Profit Analysis: Analyzes total profit and identifies top profitable products.
4. Handling Limited Data: Offers techniques for working with datasets missing customer feedback.

## Technologies

- RFM Analysis Techniques: For detailed customer segmentation based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.

## Key Functions
=RScore(x, p, d): Calculates the Recency score for a customer.
-FMScore(x, p, d): Determines the Frequency and Monetary score.
